Image Downloader
================
If you need to bulk download images from a web page, with this extension you can:
- See images that the page contains and links to
- Filter them by width, height, and URL; supports wildcard and regex
- Optionally show only images from links
- Select images to download by clicking on the image
- Use dedicated buttons to download or open individual images in new tabs
- Customize image display width, columns, border size, and color
- Hide filters, buttons and notifications you don't need

When you press the "Download" button, all selected images are saved to the default download directory of Chrome, or to a directory inside it if you specify a subfolder name.

WARNING: If you haven't set up a default download directory, you will have to manually choose the save location for each image, which might open a lot of popup windows. It is not recommended to attempt to download too many images at once without a default download directory.

Known Issues
================
This extension can't always extract the full-resolution images that open when you click a photo (e.g. in Facebook albums). That's because the page doesn't directly link to the image, but uses a script.
If you need that kind of functionality, there are other extensions that can be useful like Hover Zoom, even if you can't mass download images with it.

Change Log

- Replaced deprecated `chrome.extension` calls with `chrome.runtime`

2.2:

- Fixed a few minor display issues
- Added settings for number of columns, removed border style setting
- Added donation buttons on the options page

1.3:
- Images used in a style tag will now also be included at the end of the list. Only images from inline style attributes of elements used to be included.
- Added support for data URI
- Several bug fixes and optimizations

1.2:
- Changed the URL above the image to be displayed in a read-only textbox
- Moved the image checkboxes to the top and added open & download buttons below each
- Initially disabled the "Download" button and "All" checkbox
- Introduced a few new options to hide filters, buttons and notification
- Removed the body width option; the width of the popup now resizes relatively to the maximum image width option
- Streamlined the design

1.1:
- Fixed saving of minimum and maximum image width
- Added the URL above the image itself and an option to toggle it
- Added wildcard filter mode (alongside normal and regex)
- The state of the selected filters will now be saved
- Moved the "Sort by URL" option back to the filters

- Refactored a lot of code, especially the use of local storage

1.0.13:

- Added a download confirmation

1.0.9:
- The number of images will now be displayed next to the "All" checkbox

1.0.8:
- Added detection of image URLs in anchor tags; note that this feature will not detect URLs that don't have .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .png file extensions - it relies on a regular expression as to avoid possibly sending hundreds of requests to external servers

1.0.7:
- Removed the desktop notification system that popped up when you press "Download" in favor of a text description that should feel easier to control (through Options) and less intrusive; this should also require less permissions for the extension
- Added an option to hide the download notification; most people should understand the download process after only reading it once
- Made some minor UI tweaks

1.0.6:
- Fixed an issue with multiple unnecessary empty images

1.0.5:
- Elements that display an image using the "background-image" CSS property will now also be extracted
